# Keyboard Shortcuts

This document provides an overview of the keyboard shortcuts available in the application to help you navigate and perform actions more efficiently.

## How to Use Keyboard Shortcuts

1. **Make sure you're not in an input field or text editor** when trying to use global shortcuts.
2. **Press the key combinations** as shown in the tables below.
3. **Look for toast notifications** that confirm your shortcut was recognized.
4. **Press `?` at any time** to see a list of all available shortcuts.

## Navigation Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `G` then `D` | Navigate to Dashboard |
| `G` then `P` | Navigate to Projects |
| `G` then `T` | Navigate to Tasks |

## Action Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `N` | Navigate to Tasks page |
| `Ctrl+N` | Navigate to Tasks page (alternative) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | Navigate to Projects page |
| `R` | View Reports |
| `Ctrl+R` | View Reports (alternative) |
| `/` | Focus Search |
| `Ctrl+/` | Focus Search (alternative) |
| `?` | Show Keyboard Shortcuts Help |

| `F` | Toggle Full Screen (in editors) |

## Editor Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |

| `Enter` | Submit comment (in comment editor) |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert new line (in comment editor) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save current item |

## Tips for Using Keyboard Shortcuts

1. **Sequence Shortcuts**: For shortcuts like `G` then `D`, press and release the first key (`G`), then press the second key (`D`). A visual indicator will appear when you've pressed the first key in a sequence.

2. **Context-Sensitive Shortcuts**: Some shortcuts only work in specific contexts. For example, `Enter` to submit a comment only works when you're focused in the comment editor.

3. **Browser Conflicts**: Some shortcuts might conflict with browser shortcuts. If a shortcut doesn't work, try using an alternative version (e.g., if `N` doesn't work, try `Ctrl+N`).

4. **Editable Fields**: Shortcuts are disabled when you're typing in text fields, textareas, or rich text editors to prevent interference with your typing.

## Troubleshooting

If shortcuts aren't working:

1. **Refresh your browser** to ensure you have the latest code.
2. **Check if you're in an input field** - shortcuts won't work when typing.
3. **Try alternative shortcuts** - some browsers or extensions may block certain key combinations.
4. **Look at the browser console** (F12) for any error messages.
5. **Disable browser extensions** that might be capturing keyboard events.

## Customizing Shortcuts

Currently, keyboard shortcuts are not customizable. If you have suggestions for additional shortcuts or would like to request customization options, please contact the development team.
